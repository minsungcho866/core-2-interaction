        1. The story begins on the day that I got my first phone. 
        The phone did not have many functions. I was able to call, 
        play some simple games, and message. However, There was one 
        more button in the phone. I had a diamond shaped button that 
        was big and placed in the middle. 

        2. I was so curious about the button and asked my mom what 
        that button was. My mom said “You have to pay a thousand 
        dollars if you press that button.” As a kid, that was a very 
        large amount of money and I was so scared of myself 
        accidentally pressing the button. 

        3. However, I still had a curiosity about the function of 
        that button. One day, when I was alone at home, I came out 
        with a plan to press that button. The plan was to press the 
        button and then take out the battery of the phone so that 
        no one can see it. It was a stupid plan but back then that 
        was the best I could think of. 

        4. I turned on my phone and took a deep breath. Then I 
        quickly pressed the button and right after I saw what was 
        on the screen, I took the battery out on the phone. 

        5. The button was to access the internet and this was the 
        first time I experienced the internet.
