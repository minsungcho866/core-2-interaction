        The EU elections are coming up soon. And of us who will be affected the most by this <span class="color">crisis</span>, 
        people like me, are <span class="color">not allowed to vote</span>. Nor are we in a position to shape the decisions of business, politics, engineering, 
        media, education or science. Because the time it takes for us to <span class="color">educate ourselves</span> to do that simply <span class="color">no longer exists</span>.
        And that is why millions of children are <span class="color">taking it to the streets</span>, school striking for the climate to create attention for the 
        <span class="color">climate crisis</span>.
        <span class="colortwo">You need to listen to us</span>, we who <span class="color">cannot vote</span>. <span class="colortwo">You need to vote for us</span>, for your children and grandchildren.
        What we are doing now can soon no longer be undone.
        In this election <span class="colortwo">you vote for the future living conditions of humankind</span>.
        And though the politics needed do not exist today, some alternatives are certainly less worse than others. 
        And I have read that some parties <span class="color">do not even want me standing here</span> today because they so desperately do not want to talk about 
        <span class="color">climate breakdown</span>.
