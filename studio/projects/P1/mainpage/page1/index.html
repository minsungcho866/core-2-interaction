    <h1>Our civilization is so <span class="text-color">fragile</span>. It is almost like a <span class="text-color">castle built in the sand</span>.
The facade is so <span class="text-color">beautiful</span>. But the foundations are <span class="text-color">far from solid</span>.
We have been cutting so many corners.
Yesterday the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how the <span class="text-color">Notre Dame burnt in Paris</span>.
Some buildings are much more than just buildings.
But the Notre Dame will be rebuilt.
I hope that its <span class="text-color">foundations are strong</span>.</h1>
