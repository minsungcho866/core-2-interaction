    <h1> I want you to act as if your house was on <span class="text-color">fire</span>.
I have said those words before
And a lot of people has explained why that is a <span class="text-color">bad idea</span>.
A great number of politicians have told me that <span class="text-color">panic never leads to anything good</span>.
And I agree.
To panic unless you have to is a <span class="text-color">terrible idea</span>.
But when your house is on fire and you want to keep your house from burning to the ground, then that does require some level of panic.
Our civilization is so <span class="text-color">fragile</span>. It is almost like a <span class="text-color">castle built in the sand</span>.
The facade is so <span class="text-color">beautiful</span>. But the foundations are <span class="text-color">far from solid</span>.
We have been cutting so many corners.
Yesterday the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how the <span class="text-color">Notre Dame burnt in Paris</span>.
Some buildings are much more than just buildings.
But the Notre Dame will be rebuilt.
I hope that its <span class="text-color">foundations are strong</span>.</h1>
