            <h1>If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like you do today.<br>
            You would change almost every part of your behavior. As you do in an emergency.<br>
            <br>
            If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t fly around the world in business class chatting about how the market will solve everything with clever small solutions to specific isolated problems.<br>
            <br>
            You wouldn’t talk about buying and building your way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building things.<br>
            <br>
            If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t hold 3 emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and environment.<br>
            <br>
            You wouldn’t be arguing about phasing out coal in 15 or 11 years.<br>
            If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t be celebrating that one single nation like Ireland may soon divest from fossil fuels.<br>
            <br>
            You wouldn’t celebrate that Norway has decided to stop drilling for oil outside the scenic resort of Lofoten Island, but will continue to drill everywhere else for decades.<br>
            It’s 30 years too late for that kind of celebration.<br>
            <br>
            If our house was falling apart, the media wouldn’t be writing about anything else. The ongoing climate and ecological crises would make up all the headlines.<br>
            <br>
            If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t say that you have the situation under control and place the future living conditions for all living species in the hands of inventions that are yet to be invented.<br>
            And you would not spend all your time as politicians arguing about taxes or Brexit.<br>
            <br>
            If the walls of our house truly came tumbling down, surely you would set your differences aside and start cooperating.<br>
            <br>
