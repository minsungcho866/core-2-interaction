<h1>What would you do</h1>
<a href="https://clok.uclan.ac.uk/9573/1/Human%20Behaviour%20Paper%202012.pdf"><button class="button">
    <span>
        If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like you do today.<br>
    You would change almost every part of your behavior. As you do in an emergency.<br>
</span></button></a>

    <span>
        If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t fly around the world in business 
        class chatting about how the market will solve everything with clever small 
        solutions to specific isolated problems.
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://akawut.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/530314_structures_or_why_things_2-2560.pdf"><button class="button">
    <span>
        You wouldn’t talk about buying and building your way out of a crisis that has 
        been created by buying and building things.<br>
</span></button></a>

    <span>
    If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t hold 3 emergency Brexit summits and no 
    emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and environment.<br>
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://cgs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2022-07/US%20Coal%20Phase-Out%20Brief%20%282%29.pdf"><button class="button">
    <span>You wouldn’t be arguing about phasing out coal in 15 or 11 years.
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://www.epa.ie/publications/research/climate-change/Research_Report_302.pdf"><button class="button">
    <span>
        If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t be celebrating that one 
        single nation like Ireland may soon divest from fossil fuels.<br>
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://www.lifeinnorway.net/lofoten-oil-drilling/"><button class="button">
    <span>You wouldn’t celebrate that Norway has decided to stop drilling for 
        oil outside the scenic resort of Lofoten Island, but will continue to 
        drill everywhere else for decades. It’s 30 years too late for that kind 
        of celebration.</span></button></a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/"><button class="button">
    <span>
        If our house was falling apart, the media wouldn’t be writing about anything 
        else. The ongoing climate and ecological crises would make up all the headlines.<br>
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/tax/deloitte-uk-tax-technical-paper-brexit-aug-2019.pdf"><button class="button">
    <span>
        If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t say that you have the situation 
        under control and place the future living conditions for all living species 
        in the hands of inventions that are yet to be invented.
        And you would not spend all your time as politicians arguing about taxes or Brexit.<br>
</span></button></a>
<a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.html"><button class="button">
    <span>
        If the walls of our house truly came tumbling down, surely you would set your 
        differences aside and start cooperating.
