            <p>Asia Society is proud to present COAL + ICE, an immersive photography and video exhibition accompanied by a series of related programs. COAL + ICE visualizes the causes and consequences of the climate crisis and foregrounds creative solutions.

                Climate change takes center stage at Asia Society, including performances, films, panel discussions, and more. Asia Society has also joined forces with a network of partner organizations across New York City’s five boroughs to concurrently present exhibitions and events, expanding the conversation to inspire deeper engagement on how the climate crisis affects our global and local communities. The exhibition is co-curated by Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas and international exhibition designer Jeroen de Vries, and led by Orville Schell, Asia Society Vice President and Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations.

                COAL + ICE is on view at Asia Society Museum in New York from February 13 through August 11, 2024. To learn more, visit AsiaSociety.org/CoalandIce.</p>

                <p>The Climate “Posterator” (Poster + Creator) was a globally accessible digital platform for designing original posters in response to the climate crisis created especially for the COAL + ICE exhibition. Users were able to create their own unique designs by pairing images from the COAL + ICE exhibition with text to print or share online. All posters were featured inside the exhibition. Ten designs were awarded a prize of $1,500 each supported by the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation. Presented in collaboration with Amplifier.</p>
