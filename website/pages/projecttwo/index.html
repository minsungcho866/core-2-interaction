    <h1>WALLET SAVER MAP</h1>
    <p>“WALLET SAVER MAP: A Map For College Students Low Budget” is a web 
        design project aimed at providing invaluable assistance to college 
        students navigating Manhattan on a limited budget. Created by Minsung Cho,
         a sophomore student at Parsons School of Design, this project is a testament 
         to his commitment to addressing real world challenges through design. The main 
         part of the project lies in its organized database of restaurants in Manhattan, 
         each categorized based on affordability. Understanding the financial constraints 
         faced by college students, Minsung has categorized the restaurants into three main 
         groups: high, medium, and low-cost, corresponding to expensive, moderate, and affordable 
         options.</p>
